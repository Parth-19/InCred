This Personal Data Protection Policy Statement supplements but does not supersede or replace any other consent you may have previously provided to INCRED CAPITAL in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights to which INCRED CAPITAL may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data.
<br><br>

Apart from Personal Data, we may collect other types of information which is not linked to a natural person and which is anonymous.
